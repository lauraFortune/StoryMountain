Running, you look back over your sholulder to see if the mother bird is following. At that moment you find yourself falling, towards the earth's surface. You feel like a yo-yo, bouncing up and down, until you finally come to rest at the center of gravity, the point where you will neither rise nor fall - doomed to drift forever.",
